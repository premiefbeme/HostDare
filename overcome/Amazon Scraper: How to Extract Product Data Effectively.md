## Free Amazon Scraper Tool

A free Amazon scraper allows you to extract product data from any Amazon department page. Before using this tool, ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.

### Installation

Clone the repository and run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

### How to Retrieve Amazon URLs for Scraping

To begin, navigate to the Amazon department page you want to scrape. For instance, select the **Computers & Accessories** department, and copy the URL from your browser. You will need this URL to scrape product data.

### Running the Scraper

Run the following command to start scraping:

```bash
make scrape URL="<amazon_department_page_url>"
```

For example:

```bash
make scrape URL="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=specialty-aps&bbn=16225009011&rh=n%3A%2116225009011%2Cn%3A541966&ref=nav_em__nav_desktop_sa_intl_computers_and_accessories_0_2_5_6"
```

Ensure the URL is enclosed in quotes to prevent parsing errors.

After running the command, the scraper will process the provided URL and notify you of any out-of-stock items.

- **URL**: The product's Amazon page URL.
- **ASIN Code**: The product's unique identifier.
- **Image URL**: The URL of the product image.
- **Price**: The product's price. This field may be empty if the item is out of stock.

## Advanced Amazon Scraping with APIs

For larger projects, a scraping API is a better choice. APIs like ScraperAPI simplify the process, bypassing anti-scraping mechanisms like CAPTCHAs and IP blocking.

### Why Use ScraperAPI?

ScraperAPI handles millions of requests, automatically rotating proxies, solving CAPTCHAs, and rendering JavaScript when necessary. It supports scraping from Amazon and other major platforms like Walmart, Google, and eBay.

### Example Python Code with ScraperAPI

Hereâ€™s an example script to scrape Amazon product data using ScraperAPI:

```python
import json
from parsel import Selector
from scraper_api import ScraperAPIClient

# Initialize ScraperAPI client
client = ScraperAPIClient(api_key="SCRAPE9837861")

# Define scrape function
def scrape_amazon_product(url: str):
    response = client.get(url)
    if response.ok:
        selector = Selector(response.text)
        data = selector.xpath('//script[@id="__NEXT_DATA__"]/text()').get()
        return json.loads(data)
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to fetch data.")

# Example usage
url = "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5M7S6K"
product_data = scrape_amazon_product(url)
print(product_data["props"]["pageProps"]["initialData"]["data"]["product"])
```
