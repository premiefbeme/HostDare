# Using AWS Glue Crawlers to Populate the Data Catalog

AWS Glue crawlers offer an efficient way to populate the **AWS Glue Data Catalog** with databases and tables. This is the primary method for most AWS Glue users to organize and manage their data. A single crawler can process multiple data stores in one run, automatically creating or updating tables in the Data Catalog. These tables can then serve as sources or targets for **ETL jobs** in AWS Glue.

## Workflow

Below is a simplified workflow of how AWS Glue crawlers interact with data stores to populate the Data Catalog:

![AWS Glue Workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/glue/latest/dg/images/PopulateCatalog-overview.png)

### Steps to Populate the Data Catalog

1. **Run Classifiers:**  
   Custom classifiers are executed to infer the data format and schema. The first successful classifier creates the schema, skipping the remaining ones.

2. **Fallback to Built-In Classifiers:**  
   If no custom classifier matches the schema, built-in classifiers (e.g., JSON) are used to recognize the data.

3. **Connect to Data Store:**  
   The crawler connects to the data store, using connection properties when required.

4. **Infer Schema:**  
   Based on the identified structure, the schema for the data is created.

5. **Write Metadata:**  
   The metadata is stored in the Data Catalog as table definitions. These tables reside in a database, with attributes such as classification labels provided by the classifier.

## How Crawlers Work

When a crawler runs, it performs the following actions:

- **Classifies Data:**  
  Determines the format, schema, and properties of the raw data. Custom classifiers can be used for specific formats.

- **Groups Data into Tables or Partitions:**  
  Data is grouped using crawler heuristics.

- **Writes Metadata to the Data Catalog:**  
  Updates, adds, or deletes tables and partitions based on the crawlerâ€™s configuration.

### Custom and Built-In Classifiers

AWS Glue includes **built-in classifiers** for common file formats like JSON, CSV, and Apache Avro. You can also create **custom classifiers** for unique data formats. These classifiers evaluate data to infer table schemas.

Learn more about [built-in classifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-classifier.html#classifier-built-in).

### Metadata and Table Naming Rules

The metadata tables created by a crawler follow strict naming conventions:

- Only alphanumeric characters and underscores (`_`) are allowed.
- Custom prefixes cannot exceed 64 characters.
- Table names cannot exceed 128 characters. Duplicate names are suffixed with a hash string.

If the crawler runs on a schedule, it updates the Data Catalog with new or modified data since the last run.

## Partition Creation in Amazon S3

When an AWS Glue crawler scans an **Amazon S3 data store**, it determines table roots and partitions. The folder structure in the S3 bucket helps the crawler identify tables and partitions based on similar schemas.

### Example 1: Single Table with Partitions

Given the following S3 structure:

```
S3://sales/year=2019/month=Jan/day=1
S3://sales/year=2019/month=Jan/day=2
S3://sales/year=2019/month=Feb/day=1
S3://sales/year=2019/month=Feb/day=2
```

If all files in the `day=n` folders share the same schema, the crawler creates a **single table** with partitions for `year`, `month`, and `day`.

### Example 2: Separate Tables

For the structure:

```
s3://bucket01/folder1/table1/partition1/file.txt
s3://bucket01/folder1/table1/partition2/file.txt
s3://bucket01/folder1/table2/partition4/file.txt
```

If `table1` and `table2` have different schemas, you must define separate **Include paths** for the crawler to create two distinct tables.

## Best Practices for Amazon Athena Integration

In Amazon Athena, each table corresponds to an S3 prefix. If objects within the same prefix have different schemas, Athena cannot distinguish them as separate tables. To avoid this:

- Create separate **Include paths** for each schema.
- Follow [Athena and AWS Glue best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/glue-best-practices.html).

By properly configuring AWS Glue crawlers, you can efficiently populate the Data Catalog, ensuring seamless integration with your ETL pipelines and tools like Amazon Athena.
