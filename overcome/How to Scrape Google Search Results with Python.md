## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS selectors
- Familiarity with web scraping concepts
- Crawlee for Python v0.4.2 or higher

---

## Setting Up the Project

To create a Google Search scraper, you need to set up your Python environment and install the required libraries. We'll guide you through each step.

## Developing the Google Search Scraper

### 1. Define the Data for Extraction

First, we need to decide on the scope of the data weâ€™ll extract. Googleâ€™s search results include various elements like maps, videos, company details, and featured snippets. For this tutorial, weâ€™ll focus on **standard search results with rankings**.

### Analyzing HTML Structure

To ensure we can extract the necessary data, we analyze the HTML code of the search results. This step confirms whether we need JavaScript rendering or if the required data is accessible directly in the HTML.

---

### 2. Configuring the Crawler

Once we understand the data structure, we can set up the crawler. We'll use **Crawlee for Python**, which integrates seamlessly with libraries like BeautifulSoup for efficient data extraction.

---

### 3. Implementing Data Extraction

By examining the HTML structure, we identify the key elements to target, such as **titles**, **URLs**, and **descriptions**. Using **BeautifulSoup**, we can iterate through each search result and extract the necessary information.

#### Writing Robust Selectors

When crafting CSS selectors, avoid relying on dynamically generated attributes. Instead, use stable identifiers like IDs or text content where possible. This ensures your scraper remains functional even if Google updates its class names.

---

### 4. Handling Pagination

Pagination is essential for scraping multiple pages of Google search results. Instead of relying on link text, we create a **language-independent CSS selector** to identify the "Next" button. We also configure the `max_crawl_depth` parameter to control the number of pages to scrape.

---

### 5. Exporting Data to CSV

After extracting the data, we save it in a structured format, such as **CSV**, for further analysis. This involves adding an export function to your script:

```python
import csv

# Sample code to export data
with open("google_results.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Rank", "Title", "URL", "Description"])
    writer.writerows(extracted_data)
```

---

### 6. Finalizing the Scraper

To complete the scraper, we implement features like ranking position tracking. By passing data between requests using `user_data`, we can maintain context and improve our analysis of search rankings.

Once finalized, the script outputs a comprehensive dataset, including:

- Query terms
- Ranking positions
- Titles and URLs
- Descriptions

---

## Exporting Results

Your results will be saved in a CSV file for easy access. Hereâ€™s an example:

For advanced use cases, consider integrating the scraper with external tools like **Zapier**, **Airbyte**, or **LangChain** for automation and analysis.
