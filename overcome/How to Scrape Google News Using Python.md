## How to Scrape Google News with Python

To scrape Google News effectively, youâ€™ll need to follow a structured approach. Below is a step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Set Up the Environment

Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### Step 2: Send HTTP Requests

Use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and retrieve Google News search results:

```python
import requests

def get_google_news(query):
    url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={query}&tbm=nws"
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text
    else:
        return None

query = "latest technology news"
html_content = get_google_news(query)
```

### Step 3: Parse HTML Content

Use `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract the desired data:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def parse_news(html_content):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")
    articles = soup.find_all("div", class_="dbsr")
    news_data = []

    for article in articles:
        headline = article.find("div", class_="JheGif nDgy9d").get_text()
        source = article.find("div", class_="XTjFC WF4CUc").get_text()
        date = article.find("span", class_="WG9SHc").get_text()
        summary = article.find("div", class_="Y3v8qd").get_text()
        link = article.a["href"]
        news_data.append({
            "headline": headline,
            "source": source,
            "date": date,
            "summary": summary,
            "link": link
        })

    return news_data

news_data = parse_news(html_content)
```

### Step 4: Store and Analyze Data

Save the extracted data in a CSV file for further analysis:

```python
import csv

def save_to_csv(news_data, filename="google_news.csv"):
    keys = news_data[0].keys()
    with open(filename, "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as output_file:
        dict_writer = csv.DictWriter(output_file, fieldnames=keys)
        dict_writer.writeheader()
        dict_writer.writerows(news_data)

save_to_csv(news_data)
```

## Handling Pagination

Google News often displays search results across multiple pages. To scrape data from multiple pages, handle pagination by modifying the query URL:

```python
def get_google_news(query, num_pages=5):
    news_data = []
    for page in range(num_pages):
        url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={query}&tbm=nws&start={page*10}"
        headers = {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36"
        }
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            html_content = response.text
            news_data.extend(parse_news(html_content))
        else:
            break
    return news_data

query = "latest technology news"
news_data = get_google_news(query)
```

## Avoiding Detection

To prevent being blocked while scraping, consider these strategies:

### 1. Use Proxies
Proxies help distribute your requests across multiple IP addresses, reducing the risk of detection. Services like [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) make proxy management seamless.

### 2. Randomize Request Intervals
Add random delays between requests to mimic human behavior:

```python
import time
import random

time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 5))
```

### 3. Rotate User Agents
Randomize the `User-Agent` header to appear as different devices:

```python
from fake_useragent import UserAgent

ua = UserAgent()
headers = {"User-Agent": ua.random}
```
