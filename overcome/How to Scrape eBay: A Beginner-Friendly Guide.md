## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites and online documents automatically. It involves using special tools, like web scrapers or APIs, to navigate a website, collect specific data, and organize it in a structured format for analysis.

### Why Scrape eBay?

Scraping eBay data has various applications, such as:

## What is a Scraping API?

A scraping API is an automated tool that extracts data from websites on your behalf. Instead of building a custom web scraper from scratch, you can use a scraping API to handle the heavy lifting. These APIs take care of challenges like managing proxies, solving CAPTCHAs, and adapting to website changes.

For example, **ScraperAPI** simplifies scraping by providing automated proxy rotation, CAPTCHA handling, and clean data output. It works across e-commerce platforms like eBay, Amazon, and Walmart.

Stop wasting time on proxies and CAPTCHAs! ScraperAPI's simple API handles millions of web scraping requests, so you can focus on the data. Get structured data from Amazon, Google, Walmart, and more. ðŸ‘‰ [Start your free trial today!](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi)

## Step-by-Step: How to Scrape eBay Data

### Step 1: Install Python

Download and install Python 3 from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, check the box to "Add Python to PATH" for seamless access from the command line.

- **Windows**: Run the installer and follow the prompts.
- **macOS**: Use the provided `.pkg` file for installation.
- **Linux**: Install Python via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3`).

### Step 2: Sign Up for a Scraping API

- Create an account with a scraping API like **ScraperAPI**.
- After registration, obtain your unique API key for authentication.

### Step 3: Understand the API Documentation

Scraping APIs provide detailed documentation outlining endpoints, request parameters, and rate limits. Familiarize yourself with the documentation to understand:

- What data you can scrape.
- How to format your requests.
- The structure of the returned data.

### Step 4: Set Up Your Development Environment

Install Python libraries like `requests` for HTTP requests and `json` for handling API responses. Use the command below to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

### Step 5: Write Your Scraping Script

Here's a Python script to get started with scraping eBay product data using ScraperAPI:

```python
import requests

# Set up your API details
API_URL = "https://api.scraperapi.com"
API_KEY = "SCRAPE9837861"

# Specify the eBay product URL to scrape
product_url = "https://www.ebay.com/itm/123456789"

# Send the API request
params = {
    "api_key": API_KEY,
    "url": product_url
}

response = requests.get(API_URL, params=params)

# Check for a successful response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print("Product Data:", data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

This script sends the eBay product URL to ScraperAPI and retrieves data like titles, prices, and reviews.

### Step 6: Parse and Process the Data

After receiving the JSON response, extract the specific fields you need:

```python
product_data = response.json()
product_title = product_data.get("title", "No title available")
product_price = product_data.get("price", "No price available")

print(f"Title: {product_title}")
print(f"Price: {product_price}")
```

### Step 7: Automate Your Scraping

Set up a **cron job** (macOS/Linux) or **Task Scheduler** (Windows) to run your script periodically. This ensures your data remains updated over time.
