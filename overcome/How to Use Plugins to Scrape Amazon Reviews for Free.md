## What Is Instant Data Scraper?

Instant Data Scraper is a Chrome extension that uses AI to extract relevant information from websites without requiring programming knowledge. This tool supports popular platforms such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Etsy, Home Depot, Craigslist, and Yelp.

After testing it, I found that it‚Äôs highly reliable for scraping Amazon customer reviews, product listings, and Q&A data. The simplicity and ease of use make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to gather information quickly and efficiently.

## How to Use Instant Data Scraper to Scrape Amazon Reviews

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to scraping Amazon reviews with Instant Data Scraper:

### Step 1: Install Instant Data Scraper

Search for ‚ÄúInstant Data Scraper‚Äù in the Chrome Web Store and install the extension. If you can‚Äôt access the Chrome Web Store, you can also install the plugin offline.

### Step 2: Open the Amazon Reviews Page

Navigate to the product‚Äôs **Reviews** page on Amazon. The URL format should look something like this:

```
https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/<ASIN>
```

Once you‚Äôre on the page, sort the reviews by **Most Recent** to ensure you‚Äôre scraping up-to-date data.
