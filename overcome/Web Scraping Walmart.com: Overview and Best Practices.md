## How to Scrape Walmart.com?

Walmartâ€™s website contains mostly static content with some dynamic elements, making it relatively straightforward to scrape. Hereâ€™s how you can scrape Walmart efficiently:

### 1. Use Reliable Web Scraping APIs
Walmart employs anti-scraping mechanisms, such as IP blocking and CAPTCHA challenges. A robust web scraping API, like ScraperAPI, can help bypass these barriers with features like proxy rotation, CAPTCHA-solving, and JavaScript rendering.

### 2. Parse Data Using NextJS Framework Variables
Walmartâ€™s product data is often stored in the `<code>__NEXT_DATA__</code>` variable in its HTML source. By extracting this JSON variable, you can access well-structured data that includes product details, pricing, availability, and more.

#### Example Python Code for Scraping Walmart

```python
import json
from parsel import Selector
from scraper_api import ScraperAPIClient

# Create an API client instance
client = ScraperAPIClient(api_key="SCRAPE9837861")

# Function to scrape Walmart
def scrape(url: str) -> dict:
    response = client.get(url)
    if response.ok:
        selector = Selector(response.text)
        # Extract the JSON data from Walmart's NextJS variable
        data = selector.xpath('//script[@id="__NEXT_DATA__"]/text()').get()
        return json.loads(data)
    else:
        raise Exception("Failed to scrape the website")

# Example usage
url = "https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889"
data = scrape(url)

# Access product details
product = data["props"]["pageProps"]["initialData"]["data"]["product"]
print(product["name"], product["priceInfo"]["currentPrice"]["price"])
```
