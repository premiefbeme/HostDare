## What Are Web Scraping Tools?

Web scraping tools automate the process of extracting data from websites. They simplify the act of gathering information, making data collection much easier.

Today, many companies use anti-scraping technologies to protect publicly available data, such as CAPTCHA, fingerprinting, and rate limiting. These defenses can halt your data collection efforts if you're unprepared.

Web scraping tools are designed to overcome these challenges. They provide essential features to ensure uninterrupted data collection from websites.
