## Does Walmart Allow Scraping?

Scraping data from Walmart can be challenging. The platform employs various measures, such as:

- **Anti-spam systems**: These block the access of web scrapers.
- **IP tracking and blocking**: Requests from unauthorized sources are quickly detected and denied.
- **Cookies, Captchas, and AI systems**: Advanced protections make it difficult for scrapers to collect data.

### How to Work Around Walmart's Scraping Restrictions

By bypassing IP tracking and incorporating Captcha-solving capabilities, you can scrape Walmart data without getting detected or banned. This is where rotating residential proxies can be a game-changer.

Using professional scraping tools that include these features is the most efficient way to collect Walmart data. For experienced coders, custom scripts that integrate these functionalities can also achieve the desired results. However, always ensure you're only scraping public data to avoid violating local laws.
