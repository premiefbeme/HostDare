# Web Scraping in Java and Spring Boot: Comprehensive Guide for 2025

Web scraping has become an essential tool for accessing structured and unstructured data from websites. In this guide, we dive deep into **web scraping with Java and Spring Boot**, using advanced techniques like **deep crawling** to uncover valuable information hidden across various web pages.

With the combination of **Java Spring Boot** and powerful libraries like **JSoup** and **Crawlbase Java SDK**, weâ€™ll walk through the entire process of building a Java-based web scraper. By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll have all the tools needed to extract, analyze, and store data efficiently.

## What is Deep Crawling?

Deep crawling goes beyond surface-level scraping by exploring every layer of a website, including hidden pages and links, to extract comprehensive data. This contrasts with **shallow crawling**, which typically scans only the most accessible parts of a site, like the homepage or specific sections.

### Key Differences Between Shallow and Deep Crawling

| Feature            | Shallow Crawling                                   | Deep Crawling                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**          | Scans limited sections of a website               | Digs deep into all pages and links               |
| **Data Access**    | Retrieves surface-level data                      | Extracts detailed, hidden information            |
| **Use Cases**      | General monitoring of websites                    | Comprehensive data analysis for research or business |

### Why is Deep Crawling Important?

Deep crawling enables businesses, researchers, and developers to access extensive data, such as:

- **Market Intelligence:** Monitor competitor pricing, inventory, and trends.
- **Research:** Analyze sentiment and trends across news articles or social media.
- **Content Insights:** Understand customer behaviors, feedback, and preferences.

## Tools for Web Scraping in Java

To build an efficient Java web scraper, youâ€™ll need the following tools and libraries:

1. **Java Spring Boot:** For building and running web applications.
2. **Crawlbase Crawler SDK:** An intelligent web scraping tool for real-time data extraction.
3. **JSoup:** A powerful library for parsing HTML and extracting data.
4. **MySQL:** For storing the extracted data.
5. **Ngrok:** To expose your local server (webhook) for public access.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

### Java Installation
1. Install Java JDK:
   - **Ubuntu:**  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install default-jdk
     java -version
     ```
   - **Windows:** Download the JDK from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

### Spring Tool Suite (STS)
1. Download STS from the [official website](https://spring.io/tools).
2. Extract and install the IDE for managing Spring Boot projects.

### MySQL Setup
1. Install MySQL:
   - **Ubuntu:**  
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install mysql-server
     ```
   - **Windows:** Download the installer from [MySQL's website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

2. Create a database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE web_scraping;
   ```

## Building the Java Web Scraper

### 1. Create a Spring Boot Project

Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to set up your project:
- Add dependencies: **Spring Web**, **Spring Data JPA**, **MySQL Driver**, and **Lombok**.
- Generate the project and import it into Spring Tool Suite.

### 2. Set Up the Crawlbase Crawler

Crawlbase provides an advanced API for extracting data:
- Add the Crawlbase dependency to your `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.crawlbase</groupId>
       <artifactId>crawlbase-java-sdk-pom</artifactId>
       <version>1.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

### 3. Database Configuration

Add the following properties in your `application.properties` file:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/web_scraping
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

crawlbase.token=your_crawlbase_token
crawlbase.crawler=your_crawlbase_crawler_name
```

### 4. Implementing the Web Scraper

#### Define Models

Create two models for handling request and response data:
- `CrawlerRequest.java`
- `CrawlerResponse.java`

#### Controller and Service

Set up controllers and services to handle:
1. **Submitting URLs to Crawlbase:**
   - Push URLs to Crawlbaseâ€™s API.
   - Store the request ID (RID) for tracking.
2. **Handling Webhook Responses:**
   - Process responses from Crawlbase.
   - Extract and save HTML content.
   - Identify and push new URLs for deep crawling.

Example: **Webhook Controller**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/webhook")
public class WebhookController {
    @PostMapping("/crawlbase")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> handleWebhook(@RequestBody WebhookRequest request) {
        // Process webhook response
        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
}
```

### 5. Running the Scraper

1. Launch the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Expose the webhook using Ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8080
   ```

3. Create and configure your Crawlbase crawler with the Ngrok public URL.

### 6. Start Crawling

Submit URLs to the `/scrape/push-urls` endpoint to start the crawling process. Use tools like Postman to test the API.

## Analyzing the Output

After crawling:
- Parent and child URLs are stored in the **crawler_request** table.
- Crawled HTML content is saved in the **crawler_response** table.
- Analyze and extract meaningful insights from the data.

---

## Conclusion

Web scraping with Java and Spring Boot provides a powerful framework for extracting and analyzing web data. By combining Javaâ€™s robustness with tools like JSoup and Crawlbase, you can efficiently perform deep crawling and uncover valuable insights. Use this guide as your starting point to build scalable and efficient web scrapers.
